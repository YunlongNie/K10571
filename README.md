### sim_linear.R simlulation study when g functions are linear. 

### sim_nonlinear.R simulation study when g functions are non linear. 

Ben: The noise level seem to be too large (sigma=1) for the nonlinear example (true function ranges between -1 and 1)? Did you change it for the plots you produced? I have added your non linear function to my notebook as well. - Luyao
